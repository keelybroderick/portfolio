                        <p>Women make up 35% of Black business owners. They receive less business financing, less frequently, and at higher rates, while only 18% of Black business owners report receiving assistance from loan officers in filling out applications. Black entrepreneurs are three times as likely as white entrepreneurs to say that a lack of access to capital negatively affects their businesses’ profitability and almost twice as likely to cite the cost of capital.</p>

                        <p>The current social climate in America is a double-edge sword for minority business owners. Because the conversation about race is so prevalent, Black entrepreneurs are no longer invisible. More new and existing black businesses are striving to eventually overcome barriers because they want to pursue their own interests and are unsatisfied with corporate America.</p>

                        <p class="leftindented2">We picked a color scheme that adhered to the brand guidelines (b&w), adding our own accent color to add contrast and assist with usability. We ensured our color scheme was color blind safe and kept accessibility in mind by using white space throughout the app. We also refrained from using true black to avoid user eye strain due to contrast, opting instead for a dark gray.</p>
